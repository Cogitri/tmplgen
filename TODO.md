# TODO

## Error checking
* Check if package exists on RubyGems.org before querying it
* Generally don't assume that stuff's going right

## Template output
* Split lines if they're longer than 80 chars
* Fix license field for crates
* Recursively generate templates for gems
* Generate the checksums for the user (?)
* Conditionally install license if required
